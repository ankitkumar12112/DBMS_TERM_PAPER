\section{Abstract}

Today's web-based technology provides a plethora of online services in nearly every 
industry. To get closer to the growing digital market, every vital sector is changing 
and building a digital face for all of its core activities. In today's environment, 
information flows at a breakneck pace, and duplicate measures will not benefit the 
individual or organization that employs them. All well-organized and well-managed 
enterprises today require online connectivity. One such industry is healthcare, where 
information should be digitized quickly and effectively. This study targets that 
specific area that sets the path for the development of software that facilitates the 
transition from paper to electronic documents. The paper narrates an idea for a webbased platform that removes the requirement for paper instructions in hospitals and 
suggests E-Medical Management, which will improve the efficiency of patient 
management, doctor schedule management, and provide universal access to patient 
data anywhere in the hospital.[1]\\ \\
